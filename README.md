# Gillon D. Marchetti, Esq.  
**Senior Policy Analyst | Public Interest Technologist | Veterans Advocate**

As a senior policy analyst, licensed attorney, and U.S. Army veteran with over 20 years of federal service, I have dedicated my career to improving the delivery of benefits and services to Veterans. My recent work has focused on the implementation of the [PACT Act](https://www.va.gov/resources/the-pact-act-and-your-va-benefits/) and modernizing VA’s systems for toxic exposure adjudication, policy alignment, and oversight.

## 🚀 Veteran Insights & Statistics Tool for Analysis (VISTA)

At the core of this initiative is the **Veteran Insights & Statistics Tool for Analysis (VISTA)**.  

VISTA is the prototype name for a customized, AI-powered veteran support tool designed to simplify and automate access to veterans’ healthcare, disability compensation, and related benefits data. It also supports in-depth research and analysis of policy issues, Veteran populations, and health trends. 

The vision is to create an AI-augmented research and decision-support system that unifies veteran-related open-source data, simplifies claims guidance, curates veteran-specific scientific resources, and can relay complex policy infrastructure from a single, queryable knowledge platform. The mission is to empower veterans, advocates, and policymakers by providing an intelligent, specialized tool trained on relevant statutes, regulations, procedures, research, and open-source federal, state, and validated organizational datasets.

## 🔍 Core Capabilities

### Benefits Navigation & Claims Structuring  
Guides users through VA's complex system by organizing relevant information and data, structuring evidence, and explaining entitlement pathways under current law in an accessible, easy-to-understand format.

### On-Demand Research & Policy Analysis  
Supports structured analysis of Veteran populations, exposure cohorts, medical conditions, and regulatory questions using federal data, regulatory logic, and historical archives to empower veteran advocates.

### Legal & Regulatory Reference  
Surfaces relevant provisions from 38 U.S.C., 38 C.F.R., the M21-1 Adjudications Procedures Manual, PACT Act provisions, and other legal precedent to support citable, evidence-based legal representation.

### PACT Act & Exposure-Focused Knowledge Base  
Maintains specialized domain knowledge on military environmental exposures, cohort-based “presumptive” medical conditions, and emerging post-deployment health concerns.

## 🌱 Development Approach

I am applying my background as a policy analyst with expertise in federal veterans’ policy, VA institutional and data knowledge, and law to the development and training of this specialized AI. The solution is being built on Google Cloud, with the project codebase managed here on GitHub.

This repository documents the development of VISTA, including its architecture, API specifications, prompt engineering, and supporting artifacts that will serve both technical and policy-facing use cases.
