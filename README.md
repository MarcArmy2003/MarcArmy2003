# 👋 Hi, I'm Gill

Boston-raised Army Veteran, policy analyst, and licensed attorney with a mission-driven approach to transforming policy into practical, data-informed systems. With over 20 years of combined military and civilian federal service, I specialize in toxic exposure science, administrative law, process modernization, veterans advocacy, and public-interest research.

## 🧠 What I'm Learning
I’m in the early stages of learning Git and GitHub, building foundational skills through personal projects. My goal is to document what I build as I explore how technology can support legal and regulatory clarity, data-driven decision-making, and operational efficiency. This space is where I experiment, iterate, and organize tools that help bridge the gap between law, policy, and analytics.

## 💼 Professional Focus
- Toxic exposure policy & rulemaking (PACT Act, Camp Lejeune, PFAS, jet fuels, Agent Orange, etc.)
- Veterans health benefits & environmental health claims
- Legal and regulatory writing (38 U.S.C. and 38 C.F.R. Parts 3 and 4)
- Data-driven oversight & decision support
- Applied research design and federal program governance

## 🛠️ Personal Projects
- **Personal Finance Tracker**: GPT + Sheets tool for structured budgeting and insights
- **Smart Recall Framework**: Natural language recall system for project tracking
- **Knowledge Systems for Policy**: Tools to automate regulatory mapping and analysis

## 🧬 Personal Details
Father of two, married to a Boston-born Irish/Italian oncology nurse, and dog dad to two Boston Terriers (Coach and Tyla) and one Puerto Rican rescue sato (Gino). I’m passionate about learning guitar, fitness, biohacking, and Veterans’ advocacy — and I take pride in building systems that connect law, data, and lived experience.
